### Contributions
One of the grey areas in contributing to the production of a DevOpsDays conf is how we answer the level of contribution.

We value any contributions and we will be lead by you to manage and communicate a realistic level of contribution. Only you can measure this.

Our recommendation is to start with a  small level (bounded context ;-) and then progress. Too often we assume best case scenarios and this causes us to not realistically count the cost of participation.

We will value anyone who wants to contribute to the successful DevOpsDays AKL/WLG, and believe that there will be a range of contributing opportunities.

Please review our [working principles](principles.md) of how we look to work to give som saftey especially for those that are new
