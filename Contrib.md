###Contributions
One of the grey areas in contributing to the production of a DevOpsDays conf is how we answer the level of contribution. 

We  value any contributions and we will be lead by you to manage and communicate a releastic level of contribution. Only you can measure this.

Our reccomendation is to start with a  small level (bounded context ;-) and then progress. Too often we assume best case scenario's and this causes us to not releastically count the cost of partiticipation.

The highest level of contribution will be those who come on board as a main organiser. These orgainersers will lead areas that 
will require a range of contributing levels.

We will value anyone who wants to contribute to the successful DevOpsDays AKL/WLG, and beleive that there will be a range of contributing opportunities.
