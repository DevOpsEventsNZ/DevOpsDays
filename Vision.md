#DevOps Day Conf Vision

The Vision/Purpose for running the conference is to educate, engage, support and grow the DevOps Community. It is my hope that this conf will provide a catalyst for people to learn, celebrate, share and be encouraged in their DevOps/CD/RelEng... journey. It is hoped that the conference will connect a community of like minded people that will meet and foster this sense of community well beyond the conf. 

For me, DevOps represents each individual's journey in impacting and changing behaviours. I believe there is great reward in providing a forum where we can share these experiences.

Tooling and process can generate huge excitment. New ideas and how these can be applied to Ops, Sec, RelEng, Dev, Test, etc - that have a profund impact on the lives of people and the organisations they work for.

I'm also excited to see a culture of gratitude and sharing in the DevOps community. The DevOpsDay ethos recommends having a not for profit org present during the conf as a 1st class citizen! Also ideas such as a food bank where people can donate food which can be given to the local food bank. I think this resonates with the DevOps people which is so great.

These are just a couple of ideas I have but I'm interested in hearing your thoughts. I encourage contributions. Just send a PR.
