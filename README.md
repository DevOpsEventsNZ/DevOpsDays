# DevOpsDay Akl & WLG
A place where the discussion, contribution and planning for a DevOpsDay conference in AKL/WLG.

I have been so encouraged with the interest and level of support for running the a DevOps Day conf, I've created this repo to help communicate, plan and hopefully produce a DevOps conf.

Our vision for the conf can be found in our [vision.md](Vision.md) doc

It is my hope that these DevOps Days will provide a tipping point for the community where like minded people can get together and share their DevOps fu.

A really good source of info is the [DevOpsDay](http://www.devopsdays.org/pages/organizing/) site itself. Check it out. There's lots to think about.

If you're interested in contributing, or just wanting to be kept in the loop, please review the [contrib.md](Contrib.md), then make a PR and add your name and contact details in one of the tables below. The only rule for contributing is that you define the level to which you contribute, i.e. a Pull model.

From a timing persepctive, I'm thinking midish 2016 - but I'm not holding a specific date in mind. Hopefuly this can give you an idea on proposed times frame, as a reference for your contribution.  The actual date will depend on lot of things, so our cone of uncertainty is high.

Any questions just ping me.
