We follow these principles:

# open by default

So that our communication is transparent, consistent and professional:

* for communication within the organising team, we use Slack channels that are open to anyone on the team to join. We minimise communication on private channels or email. 
* for communication outside the organising team, we use one of the devopsdays.nz email addresses. Ask Reuben for details and password.
  * It is ok for initial contact with a sponsor to be through a personal channel, but once in the sponsor pipeline, please always use sponsor@devopsdays.nz.
  * All communication with attendees is from attendees@devopsdays.nz
  * All communication with speakers is from speakers@devopsdays.nz
  * All other communication is from admin@devopsdays.nz

# transparent

So that we have visibility over all commitments:

* please communicate any decisions you make about devopsdays NZ via Slack

# empowerment

To keep us moving quickly:

* you are empowered to communicate your intentions over Slack, rather than seeking agreement. For example `I intend to order 6 sticky A2 pads at a cost of $420 tomorrow `
