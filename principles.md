We follow these principles:

# open by default

So that our communication is transparent, consistent and professional:

* for communication within the organising team, we use Slack channels that are open to anyone on the team to join. We minimise communication on private channels or email. 
* for communication outside the organising team, we use one of the devopsdays.nz email addresses. Ask Reuben for details and password.
  * It is ok for initial contact with a sponsor to be through a personal channel, but once in the sponsor pipeline, please always use sponsor@devopsdays.nz.
  * All communication with attendees is from attendees@devopsdays.nz
  * All communication with speakers is from speakers@devopsdays.nz
  * All other communication is from either info@devopsdays.nz or admin@devopsdays.nz

# transparent

So that we have visibility over all commitments:

* please communicate any decisions you make about devopsdays NZ via Slack

# empowerment

To keep us moving quickly:

* you are empowered to communicate your intentions over Slack, rather than seeking agreement. For example `I intend to order 6 sticky A2 pads at a cost of $420 tomorrow `

# impartial

Recognising that we all work for companies doing DevOps and all have multiple, complex relationships with other people and companies, we will be mindful of treating all parties equally. Where we feel that we are conflicted by our position, we should discuss with one of the directors (Reuben, Nigel, Adarsh, Flavia, Em). In some cases we will need to excuse ourselves from the activity, but in many cases disclosure is sufficient.

One exception is that we exert positive bias on speakers and attendees to encourage diversity.
